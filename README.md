🔧 Components
main.py
Main script for running the classification pipeline. Coordinates the preprocessing, training, and evaluation processes.

src/preprocessor.py
Image loading and dataset preparation for training

src/plotlies.py
Visualization module using Plotly:
class distribution pieplot
Training metrics visualization
Model performance analysis

src/logexp.py
Manages experiment logging and tracking:
Training progress monitoring
Performance metrics logging
Experiment configuration tracking


📊 Results
The model achieves approximately 0.8 across evaluation metrics, with specific considerations:
Strong performance on most food categories
Some confusion between visually similar items (e.g., tacos, taquitos)


🔄 Future Improvements
Data Collection Enhancements:
Improved photography guidelines for better feature visibility
Standardized image capture procedures

Model Architecture:
Two-stage classification system for similar food items
Fine-tuning of transfer learning parameters


🚀 Getting Started
Clone the repository:
!git clone https://github.com/Giovannicus/GourmetAI.git

Or save in .py and run the main script:
python main_notyebook.py


📈 Model Performance
Overall f1-score: >0.9
Detailed visualizations available through the Plotly interface
Performance analysis accessible via logging module
